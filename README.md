## How to Install the Nano-Banana Plugin

Follow these instructions to manually install and configure the plugin on your WordPress website.

### Step 1: Download and Upload the Plugin Files

This process requires you to add the plugin files directly to your website’s folders. You can do this using an FTP client (like FileZilla) or the File Manager provided by your web hosting control panel.

1.  **Download the Plugin**: First, download the `nano-banana-editor.zip` file to your computer.
2.  **Extract the Files**: Unzip the `nano-banana-editor.zip` file. This will create a new folder named `nano-banana-image-editor` (or similar).
3.  **Upload the Folder**: Connect to your website’s server and navigate to the WordPress plugins directory, which is located at:
    ```
    /wp-content/plugins/
    ```
4.  Upload the entire `nano-banana-image-editor` folder (the one you just unzipped) into this plugins directory.

### Step 2: Activate the Plugin in WordPress

Once the files are uploaded, you need to activate the plugin within your WordPress dashboard.

1.  Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard (e.g., `yourwebsite.com/wp-admin`).
2.  Navigate to **Plugins > Installed Plugins** from the left-hand menu.
3.  You should now see “Nano Banana Image Editor” in your list of plugins. Click the **Activate** link below its name.

### Step 3: Add Your Google AI API Key

2.  You will see a field to enter your **Google AI API Key**.
3.  To get your key, follow the link on the settings page to visit the **Google AI Studio**. You may need to sign in and create a new project to generate an API key.
4.  Copy your new API key from the Google AI Studio.
5.  Paste the key into the “Google AI API Key” field on your WordPress site.
6.  Click **Save Settings**.
